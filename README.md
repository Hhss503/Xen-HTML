## Xen HTML
Unified and simplified HTML rendering
=========

Xen HTML provides users the ability to display any HTML-based widget on the Lockscreen and Homescreen of their iOS devices.

### Building

This project requires iOSOpenDev. Dependant third-party libraries and private headers are included within this repository to make life easier.

### Notes for development

`XenHTML.xm` is rather horrendous; its got too many headers inline, and all modifications in SpringBoard are contained within the same file. Sorry about that.

### License

Licensed under the GPLv2. Note: any widget ran using Xen HTML is not treated as derivative work.
